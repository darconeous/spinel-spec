## Requirements Language and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

The layout diagrams in this document that show encodings of data in byte sequences use the convention described in Guide for Internet Standards Writers [@?RFC2360] section 3.1, Packet Diagrams. Specifically, bits in bytes are indexed from most significant to least significant, and the least significant bit in a field representing an integer value more than one bit in length is the least significant bit of a the signed or unsigned number, as the case requires.
