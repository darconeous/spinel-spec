1.  Introduction

   TODO: Writeme.

1.1.  Requirements Language and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The layout diagrams in this document that show encodings of data in
   octet sequences use the convention described in Guide for Internet
   Standards Writers [RFC2360] section 3.1, Packet Diagrams.
   Specifically, bits in octets are indexed from most significant to
   least significant, and the least significant bit in a field
   representing an integer value more than one bit in length is the
   least significant bit of a the signed or unsigned number, as the case
   requires.

2.  Requirements

   The network save/recall feature is an OPTIONAL NCP capability that,
   when present, allows the host to save and recall network credentials
   and state to and from nonvolatile storage.

   The presence of the save/recall feature can be detected by checking
   for the presence of the "CAP_NET_SAVE" capability in "PROP_CAPS".

Internet-Draft             Spinel Network Save              October 2017


   Network clear feature allows host to erase all network credentials
   and state from non-volatile memory.

3.  Commands

3.1.  CMD 9: (Host->NCP) CMD_NET_SAVE

                  +---------+----------+----------------+
                  | Octets: | 1        | 1              |
                  +---------+----------+----------------+
                  | Fields: | "HEADER" | "CMD_NET_SAVE" |
                  +---------+----------+----------------+

   Save network state command.  Saves any current network credentials
   and state necessary to reconnect to the current network to non-
   volatile memory.

   This operation affects non-volatile memory only.  The current network
   information stored in volatile memory is unaffected.

   The response to this command is always a "CMD_PROP_VALUE_IS" for
   "PROP_LAST_STATUS", indicating the result of the operation.

   This command is only available if the "CAP_NET_SAVE" capability is
   set.

3.2.  CMD 10: (Host->NCP) CMD_NET_CLEAR

                 +---------+----------+-----------------+
                 | Octets: | 1        | 1               |
                 +---------+----------+-----------------+
                 | Fields: | "HEADER" | "CMD_NET_CLEAR" |
                 +---------+----------+-----------------+

   Clear saved network settings command.  Erases all network credentials
   and state from non-volatile memory.  The erased settings include any
   data saved automatically by the network stack firmware and/or data
   saved by "CMD_NET_SAVE" operation.

   This operation affects non-volatile memory only.  The current network
   information stored in volatile memory is unaffected.

   The response to this command is always a "CMD_PROP_VALUE_IS" for
   "PROP_LAST_STATUS", indicating the result of the operation.

   This command is always available independent of the value of
   "CAP_NET_SAVE" capability.

3.3.  CMD 11: (Host->NCP) CMD_NET_RECALL

                   +---------+--------+----------------+
                   | Octets: |   1    |       1        |
                   +---------+--------+----------------+
                   | Fields: | HEADER | CMD_NET_RECALL |
                   +---------+--------+----------------+

   Recall saved network state command.  Recalls any previously saved
   network credentials and state previously stored by "CMD_NET_SAVE"
   from non-volatile memory.

   This command will typically generated several unsolicited property
   updates as the network state is loaded.  At the conclusion of
   loading, the authoritative response to this command is always a
   "CMD_PROP_VALUE_IS" for "PROP_LAST_STATUS", indicating the result of
   the operation.

   This command is only available if the "CAP_NET_SAVE" capability is
   set.

4.  Properties

4.1.  PROP 64: PROP_NET_SAVED

   o  Type: Read-Only
   o  Packed-Encoding: "b"

   Returns true if there is a network state stored/saved.

5.  Security Considerations

   EDITOR: Insert verbiage here conforming to RFC Editor guidelines.

6.  IANA Considerations

   EDITOR: insert verbiage here: registry creation forms, et cetera.
