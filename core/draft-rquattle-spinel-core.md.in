.# Abstract

This document specifies the core of the Spinel host-controller
protocol, which enables a general purpose application processor to
manage, control, and offload IPv6 network functions to a Network
Co-Processor (NCP) connected via a simple communication link(such as
UART, SPI, or USB).

Spinel was initially designed for use with Thread(R) network
co-processors, but the core of the protocol is general purpose and
intended to be easily adapted to other types of low-power IPv6
networking technologies.
